Cross chain music NFT infrastructure built on Wormhole Interoperability
# 🎵 NFT Convergence Project (NCP)

**Cross-chain music NFT infrastructure powered by Wormhole**

The **NFT Convergence Project (NCP)** establishes a canonical metadata registry and SDK for interoperable NFTs across **Ethereum**, **Solana**, and **TON**.  
Built using **Wormhole’s Generic Message Passing**, NCP ensures creators can maintain provenance, royalties, and ownership rights across chains.

---

## 🌐 Overview
NCP introduces a hybrid architecture combining:

- **Canonical Metadata Registry (Ethereum)** – A verified, on-chain reference for all metadata and royalty data.
- **Wormhole Cross-Chain Bridge** – Securely syncs ownership and provenance between blockchains.
- **Developer SDK & API Layer** – Simplifies integration for artists, platforms, and marketplaces.
- **Decentralized Storage (IPFS / Arweave)** – Ensures all music and metadata remain immutable and publicly verifiable.
